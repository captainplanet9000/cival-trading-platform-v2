# MCP Trading Platform - System Architecture

## Overview

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) Trading Platform is a comprehensive, enterprise-grade algorithmic trading system built using a microservices architecture. The platform provides real-time market data processing, advanced analytics, risk management, and automated trading capabilities.

## Architecture Principles

### Microservices Design
- **Service Independence**: Each service operates independently with its own data store and business logic
- **API-First**: All services expose REST APIs for inter-service communication
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous communication through WebSocket streams and message queues
- **Fault Tolerance**: Circuit breakers, retries, and graceful degradation

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Services can be scaled independently based on load
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent load distribution across service instances
- **Caching**: Multi-layer caching for performance optimization
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on demand

### Security
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and secure communication
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for compliance and monitoring
