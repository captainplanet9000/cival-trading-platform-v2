## ü§ñ Agent Trading Readiness

### Agent Management API
```python
POST /api/v1/agents                    # Create trading agent
GET  /api/v1/agents                    # List agents
POST /api/v1/agents/{id}/start         # Start agent trading
POST /api/v1/agents/{id}/stop          # Stop agent trading
GET  /api/v1/agents/{id}/status        # Get agent status
```

### Agent-to-Market Execution Bridge
```python
POST /api/v1/agents/execute-trade      # Direct agent ‚Üí market execution
{
  "source_agent_id": "agent_123",
  "trade_params": {
    "symbol": "BTC/USD",
    "side": "buy", 
    "quantity": 0.01,
    "order_type": "market"
  }
}
```

### Real-time Agent Coordination
```python
GET /api/v1/stream/agent-events        # SSE stream for agent updates
```
